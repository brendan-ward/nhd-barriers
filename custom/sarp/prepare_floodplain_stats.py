"""
Floodplain stats were generated in ArcGIS by
1. developing a floodplain mask from existing data sources and 90m around all flowlines
2. developing a binary map of natural landcover / not natural landcover
3. clipping landcover by floodplain mask
4. running zonal stats to calculate the area in natural landcover and not natural landcover in the floodplain mask

Note: some catchments have no floodplain, and some have floodplains but no NHDPlusID (outside HUC4s we processed).  These are filtered out.
